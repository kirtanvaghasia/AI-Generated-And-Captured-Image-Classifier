# AI-Generated-And-Captured-Image-Classifier
AI Image Classifier is a machine learning model that can effectively classify Real and AI Generated Images.

# Overview
• Successfully created a robust deep learning model using the FastAI library to accurately distinguish
between AI-generated and captured images.
• Employed techniques like data augmentation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize
model performance and training to ensure high accuracy and reliability.
• Designed and deployed a user-friendly web interface using Gradio, allowing users to easily upload images
and receive real-time classification results. This enhanced user accessibility and interaction with the
model
